Calculating the request threshold for the user


## Rate Limiting Library Description
This open-source library provides a user-friendly way to implement rate limiting for your application. It helps prevent abuse and overload by ensuring that individual users don't send too many requests within a specific timeframe.

## Key Features:

Per-user Rate Limiting: Enforce rate limits on a per-user basis, ideal for scenarios where you want to control the number of requests each user can make.
Configurable Limits: Easily define the maximum number of requests allowed (X) and the corresponding time window (Y seconds) for the rate limit.
Simple Integration: The library offers a straightforward API for checking if a request should be allowed based on the rate limit.

## Benefits:

Prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: By limiting the number of requests a user can send, you can protect your application from malicious attempts to overwhelm your system.
Ensures Fair Resource Allocation: Rate limiting guarantees that all users have a fair chance to access your application's resources.
Improves Scalability: By controlling the request volume, you can make your application more scalable and handle a higher number of users efficiently.
